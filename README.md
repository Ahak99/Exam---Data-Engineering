## Introduction

This repository contains Python scripts implementing the following algorithms:

- **ACP (Principal Component Analysis):** `main/experiments/template_branche_mazlin.py`
- **t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding):** `main/experiments/template_branche_hatim.py`
- **UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection):** `main/experiments/template_branche_abdelhak.py`

These algorithms are commonly used for dimensionality reduction and clustering in machine learning and data analysis.

- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `umap-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `sentence_tranformers`
- `joblib`

You can install them using:
